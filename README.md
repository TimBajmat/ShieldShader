# ShieldShader

This a shader I made for a project I am working on at this moment. It is inspired by the effect seen in [Star Wars: Battlefront 3](https://youtu.be/_IuSei4kWSU?t=1m16s). 
I have done a lot of research on the internet in order to make this effect work, and in my opinion it came out nicely.

It is a multi-pass shader, in which I combined a rim effect shader and a dissolve one. 
For a preview of this effect and more of my work, please visit my portfolio.
